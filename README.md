# ph-nextjs-utils

Some utilities we frequently use for projects built with [Next.js](https://github.com/zeit/next.js/).


## Getting Started

In apps built with Next.js, the `html` element is generated on the server and is not mutable within the Next app. Thus the `lang` attribute can only be set when a request is served by the server. This tiny utility solves this problem. 


### Installing

Install using npm:

```
npm install --save Pixelherz/ph-nextjs-utils
```

For usage examples see section [Utilities](#Utilities) below. 


## Utilities

### setHtmlLang

Set the `lang` attribute's value of the `html` element. Used in [Next.js](https://github.com/zeit/next.js/) projects as the `html` element is rendered on the server and is not mutable in the client.

```js
import { setHtmlLang }Â from 'ph-nextjs-utils'
setHtmlLang('en')
```
