## Utilities

### setHtmlLang

Set the `lang` attribute's value of the `html` element. Used in [Next.js](https://github.com/zeit/next.js/) projects as the `html` element is rendered on the server and is not mutable in the client.

```js
import { setHtmlLang }Â from '@pixelherz/nextjs-utils'
setHtmlLang('en')
```
